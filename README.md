# VR Experience
*In memory of my dear friend Mauro Guarino, RIP*

This is an small VR Experience I made for Google Cardboard in a single night during a jam where I took part as a mentor.

Controls:
Cardboard Button (screen touch) while:
* Hovering a card -> Catch it
* Hovering a column -> Move to

Don't expect a game because there isn't.
